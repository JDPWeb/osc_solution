## My process

Not much to say on my process, kind of like everything was eyeballed as I was not going for the pro at Frontend Mentor (sorry guys, you rock though).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Getting the rust off from me and getting back into te habit of coding. Will come back to the challenges in a couple months and see how I could have done better and sharpen up my skills as I move forth.

### Continued development

I guess that I will continue to focus on responsive design and the appropriate usage of flex and grid properties for the best result possible.
